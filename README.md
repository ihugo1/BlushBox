# Makeup Ecommerce ðŸ’„  

## Description  
This project is a makeup ecommerce application developed with React as a practice to enhance frontend development skills. The goal is to integrate common features of an online store while consuming a public makeup API to fetch real-world data.  

## Project Goals  
1. **Product Catalog**  
   - Display a list of makeup products fetched from an API.  
   - Implement filters by category, price, and search options.  

2. **Product Details Page**  
   - Show detailed information about a selected product.  
   - Allow selection of options (e.g., colors or shades).  

3. **Shopping Cart**  
   - Add, remove, and modify products in a shopping cart.  
   - Persist the cart state across sessions using `localStorage`.  

4. **Purchase Simulation**  
   - Review cart products before completing a purchase.  
   - Display an order confirmation upon successful purchase.  

5. **API Integration**  
   - Fetch real-world data using [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/).  

## Technologies Used  
- **React** (with Vite)  
- **CSS** (or TailwindCSS for styling)  
- **React Router** for navigation  
- **JavaScript ES6+**  

## Next Steps  
- Add basic authentication (registration and login).  
- Implement pagination in the product catalog.  
- Dynamically display promotions or discounts.
